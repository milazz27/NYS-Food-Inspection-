The new law requires you to post signs in English and Spanish, (both in the front of your establishment so the sign is visible to customers and in the back of your establishment, so it is visible to food handlers) which provide food allergen information to patrons and staff. In addition, you are required to designate staff who will be trained in an approved Allergen Training Program. If you provide seating for your customers, you must always have at least one trained person in the kitchen and one trained person in the dining room during hours of operation. If you are take out only, you must have a least one trained person in the kitchen during hours of operation. The number of trained staff must also be entered in the space proved on the posted signs. The Westchester County Health Department has designated the ServSafe Food Allergen class as an acceptable course. Follow this link to access the course: https://www.servsafe.com/ServSafe-Allergens If you wish to take another course, please contact us prior to registering to verify it is approved. The required signs are available on our website for printing. If you wish to pick up pre-printed signs in both English and Spanish, you can come to our office at 25 Moore Avenue, 2nd Floor, Mount Kisco, NY 10549 any Monday through Friday between the hours of 9:00 am and 4:00 pm.

Education regarding the Department’s Food Allergen Law was provided.  The operator was advised that they must post a notice to their employees raising food allergy awareness.  The notice must contain information on 1) the process to follow when a customer notifies an employee of a food allergy, 2) how to avoid cross-contact, and 3) the procedures to be followed in the event a customer experiences an allergic reaction, including when to call 9-1-1. The notice must be posted in a conspicuous location, and in at least one of the languages spoken by each employee, provided those languages are among those translated by the Department. The law also requires that food service establishments include the following statement on their menu or menu assembly: “If you have a food allergy, please notify us,” along with a message informing customers that allergen information is available for prepared food items. If the menu is written in a language other than English and is one that the Department makes a translation for, the menu statement must be written in that language. Please be advised that online menus must also include this statement, and a method by which a customer can indicate if they have a food allergy.  In response to this law, the Department created a Food Allergy Awareness notice containing information for food service establishment employees on food allergies. This notice, and the required menu statement, are available on the Department’s website in English as well as the top six languages spoken in the State; https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/indoors/food_safety/guidance.htm","NY","(42.699983, -74.924534)"
